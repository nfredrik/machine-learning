This is a demo of unsupervised learning where I try to cluster
(x, y) coordinates.
The problem is very similar to
`this one <http://povilasb.com/misc/machine_learning_intro.html>`_.
Except right now I have a bunch of unlabeled coordinates that I want to
cluster::

        o        ^
            o    |
          o      |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 |    x
                 |       x
                 |  x
